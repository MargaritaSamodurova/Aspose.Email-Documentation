## **Creating, Saving and Reading Tasks**
Aspose.Email for .NET allows you to create Outlook tasks and save them to MSG format. The MapiTask class provides a number of properties such as Percentcomplete, Estimatedeffort, ActualEffort, History, LastUpdate, and others, to accommodate and set information required for an Outlook task.

1. Instantiate a new object of the MapiContact class.
1. Enter task property information.
1. Save the task to disc in MSG format.
