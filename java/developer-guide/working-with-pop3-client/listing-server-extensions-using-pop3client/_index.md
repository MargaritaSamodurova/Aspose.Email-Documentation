Aspose.Email's [Pop3Client](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/email/com.aspose.email/pop3client) lets you retrieve the server extensions that a server supports such as IDLE, UNSELECT, QUOTA, etc. This helps in identifying the availability of an extension before using the client for that particular functionality. The [getCapabilities()](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/email/com.aspose.email/EmailClient#getCapabilities\(\))Â method returns the supported extension types in the form of a string array.
