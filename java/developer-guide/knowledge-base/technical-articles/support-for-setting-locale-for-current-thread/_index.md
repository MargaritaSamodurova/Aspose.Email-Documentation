Aspose.Cells provides the ability to set the Locale for the current thread. Aspose.Cells provides a class [CurrentThreadSettings](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/email/com.aspose.email/CurrentThreadSettings) that provides the [setLocale](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/email/com.aspose.email/CurrentThreadSettings#setLocale\(java.util.Locale\)) method for this purpose. The following code snippet demonstrates the use of the [CurrentThreadSettings](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/email/com.aspose.email/CurrentThreadSettings) class to set the current Locale. The snippet fist sets the Locale to an invalid value and then uses the [CurrentThreadSettings.setLocale](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/email/com.aspose.email/CurrentThreadSettings#setLocale\(java.lang.String\)) method to set the Locale for the current thread.
