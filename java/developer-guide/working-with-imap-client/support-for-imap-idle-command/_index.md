Aspose.Email API's [ImapClient](https://apireference.aspose.com/java/email/com.aspose.email/ImapClient) provides the capability to open a connection to the server and wait for the arrival of an email message. This allows avoiding polling the server again and again for any incoming email. The following code snippet demonstrates connecting to the server and waiting for emails.
