## **Using Timeout for Countering Endless Wait Operations While Saving Message to MHT Format**
Sometimes, when processing a corrupted message, an operation may be performed infinitely and thus impair the correct functionality of the application.
By using a configurable timeout, you can stop a stuck operation, handle the event, and continue executing the application.

We have added the following members to MhtSaveOptions class:

- **MhtSaveOptions.Timeout** - Limits the time in milliseconds of formatting message. The default value is 3000 milliseconds.
- **MhtSaveOptions.TimeoutReached**Â - Raised if timed out while saving to Mhtml.

Code sample:

``` cs

string fileName = "input.msg";
var mailMessage = MailMessage.Load(fileName);
MemoryStream ms = new MemoryStream();
MhtSaveOptions options = SaveOptions.DefaultMhtml;
options.Timeout = 4000;
options.TimeoutReached += TimeoutHandler;
mailMessage.Save(ms, options);


private void TimeoutHandler(object sender, EventArgs ev)
{
  // your event handling here
}

```
