**Welcome to Aspose.Email for .NET**

Aspose.Email for .NET is a suite of flexible and easy to use .NET class libraries brought together to produce the most unique and powerful email programming component. Aspose.Email saves you time and effort by allowing you to code complex message file handling into your applications quickly and easily.

Aspose.Email implements a number of network protocols, for example, SMTP, MIME, POP3, IMAP; message file formats, for example, EML, MSG, MHT; mail storage formats such as PST and MBOX; and Exchange Servers to allow developers to create a wide variety of email processing applications. Aspose.Email helps developers program without getting lost in the complexities of message format detail.

Aspose.Email for .NET also provides classes and algorithms that are useful for time-oriented recurrence patterns, or schedules. Many applications need to manage this type of information and describing and manipulating events is often a complex task. Aspose.Email frees programmers from these details by providing a simple, standards-based interface that supports complex patterns. The central concepts are coherent with the iCalendar RFC (2445), so it is easy to incorporate iCalendar features into your .NET applications.

## **Product Description**
Aspose.Email for .NET is implemented using Managed C# and can be used with any .NET language like C#, VB.NET and J# and so on. Aspose.Email for .NET can be integrated with any kind of application, from ASP.NET web applications to Windows applications. Aspose.Email also provides fully featured examples written in C#  so that developers can get up and running quickly. Aspose.Email can be used to perform a variety of tasks in applications. For example:

- Opening or saving emails in the form of EML or MHT files.
- Parsing/reading and saving Microsoft Outlook Messages and Outlook PST files.
- Dealing with MIME messages.
- Embedding objects in email messages.
- Sending bulk emails.
- Creating emails by mail merges from different types of data sources (DataTable or DataReader, and others).
- Sending iCalendar compliant messages.
- Working in asynchronous mode.
- Receiving and managing emails using POP3.
- Accessing and managing emails using IMAP.
- Verifying email addresses.
- Receiving and managing emails using Microsoft Exchange Server and other email servers.
## **Declaration**
All Aspose .NET components require Full Trust permission set. The reason is, Aspose .NET components need to access registry settings, system files other than virtual directory for certain operations like parsing fonts, etc. Moreover, Aspose .NET Components are based on core .NET system classes that also require Full Trust permission set in many cases.

Internet Service Providers hosting multiple applications from different companies mostly enforce Medium Trust security level. In the case of .NET 2.0, such security level applies the following constraints:

- OleDbPermission is not available. This means you cannot use the ADO.NET managed OLE DB data provider to access databases.
- EventLogPermission is not available. This means you cannot access the Windows event log.
- ReflectionPermission is not available. This means you cannot use reflection.
- RegistryPermission is not available. This means you cannot access the registry.
- WebPermission is restricted. This means your application can only communicate with an address or range of addresses that you define in the <trust> element.
- FileIOPermission is restricted. This means you can only access files in your application's virtual directory hierarchy.

Due to the reasons specified above, Aspose .NET components cannot be used on servers granting permission set other than Full Trust.
