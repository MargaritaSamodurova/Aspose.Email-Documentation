**Welcome to Aspose.Email for .NET**

Aspose.Email for .NET is a suite of flexible and easy to use .NET class libraries brought together to produce the most unique and powerful email programming component. Aspose.Email saves you time and effort by allowing you to code complex message file handling into your applications quickly and easily.

Aspose.Email implements a number of network protocols, for example, SMTP, MIME, POP3, IMAP; message file formats, for example, EML, MSG, MHT; mail storage formats such as PST and MBOX; and Exchange Servers to allow developers to create a wide variety of email processing applications. Aspose.Email helps developers program without getting lost in the complexities of message format detail.

Aspose.Email for .NET also provides classes and algorithms that are useful for time-oriented recurrence patterns, or schedules. Many applications need to manage this type of information and describing and manipulating events is often a complex task. Aspose.Email frees programmers from these details by providing a simple, standards-based interface that supports complex patterns. The central concepts are coherent with the iCalendar RFC (2445), so it is easy to incorporate iCalendar features into your .NET applications.

## **Declaration**

All Aspose .NET components require Full Trust permission set. The reason is, Aspose .NET components need to access registry settings, system files other than virtual directory for certain operations like parsing fonts, etc. Moreover, Aspose .NET Components are based on core .NET system classes that also require Full Trust permission set in many cases.

Internet Service Providers hosting multiple applications from different companies mostly enforce Medium Trust security level. In the case of .NET 2.0, such security level applies the following constraints:

- OleDbPermissionÂ is not available. This means you cannot use the ADO.NET managed OLE DB data provider to access databases.
- EventLogPermissionÂ is not available. This means you cannot access the Windows event log.
- ReflectionPermissionÂ is not available. This means you cannot use reflection.
- RegistryPermissionÂ is not available. This means you cannot access the registry.
- WebPermissionÂ is restricted. This means your application can only communicate with an address or range of addresses that you define in the <trust> element.
- FileIOPermissionÂ is restricted. This means you can only access files in your application's virtual directory hierarchy.

Due to the reasons specified above, Aspose .NET components cannot be used on servers granting permission set other than Full Trust.
